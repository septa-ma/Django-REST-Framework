# Django-rest-framework

# Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

# Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:
- - It has a web browsable API.
- - Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
- - Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
- - You can just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features. 
  For example you can use mixin or generic-class modules for makeing views.
- - Extensive documentation, ( https://www.django-rest-framework.org ) and great community support.
